				<p>This is my first winter in Ann Arbor, and it has welcomed me pleasantly.

				<h4>Description</h4>
				<p>Catching a glimpse of The Empire State Building from Highline at New york City was a great start to my new year.
					The weather was cold and breezy that day, when I had decided to not carry my overcoat. I am grateful for the time this picture was
					taken, it really captured the purple and orange coloured skies with this monumental building.

				<h4>Description</h4>
				<p>I visited The Tunnel, during the festive searon, hence I was able to witness it this lit up.
					I love how the reflection of the lights make the copper coloured tunnel shine even more. 
					That day, this place was crowded as well as the Saks Mall accross the Tunnel. This day also 
					marks the day I bought the most expensive peice of beautiful luxurious perfume I own, a 10ml bottle. </p>

				<p>This steam chimney building is at the junction of Huron and Glenn.

				<h4>Description</h4>
				<p>Inside the concrete jungle, the city of New York, was an amazing feeling. I love how the yellow taxis, give a contrast to the grey background, 
					and forming a leading line. It makes this picture a dynamic motion bsaed picture. This picture is no special
					piture, apart from the fact that it reminds me how I was video calling my grandmother,
					who were in Kerela, India back then. I miss my grandmother, wish I could video call her whenever I want, just to see her
					and hear her voice.
